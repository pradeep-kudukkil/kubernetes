Modify Certificate Configuration:
/var/snap/microk8s/current/certs/csr.conf.template  
IP.3 = <private_ip>  
IP.4 = <public_ip> 
Add private and public IPs to the certificate configuration.

Verify Certificate Details:
openssl x509 -in /var/snap/microk8s/current/certs/server.crt -text -noout  
Check if the certificate includes the public IP.

Regenerate Certificates (if public IP is missing):
sudo microk8s refresh-certs --cert server.crt  
microk8s stop  
microk8s start  

Generate and Modify Kubeconfig:
microk8s config > kubeconfig.yaml  
Export kubeconfig and update it with the public IP for external access.
